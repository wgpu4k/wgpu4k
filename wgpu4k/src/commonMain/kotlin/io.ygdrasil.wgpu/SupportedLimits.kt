/**
 * The GPUSupportedLimits interface of the WebGPU API describes the limits supported by a [Adapter].
 *
 * The GPUSupportedLimits object for the current adapter is accessed via the [Adapter.limits] property.
 *
 * You should note that, rather than reporting the exact limits of each GPU, browsers will likely report different
 * tier values of different limits to reduce the unique information available to drive-by fingerprinting. For example,
 * the tiers of a certain limit might be 2048, 8192, and 32768. If your GPU's actual limit is 16384, the browser will
 * still report 8192.
 *
 * Given that different browsers will handle this differently and the tier values may change over time, it is hard to
 * provide an accurate account of what limit values to expect â€” thorough testing is advised.
 *
 * Instance properties
 * The following limits are represented by properties in a GPUSupportedLimits object. See the [Limits](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#limits) section of the
 * specification for detailed descriptions of what the limits relate to.
